I am a clinical operations specialist and health products manager who is passionate about leading the digital and physical transformation of our workplaces, clinics and labs to improve the quality of life for neurodivergents with physical disabilities.

As a future innovator in mental health and artificial intelligence, I am dedicated to healing mistrust by humanizing the justice of data-driven healthcare and publicizing the power of medical informatics so that we can bridge the intergenerational gap with ethical technology.
