**I am committed** to being part of a team that supports the promotion of health equity through patient advocacy and evidence-based continuity of care. #As a survivor# of {multi-generational trauma}, not having access to my family medical history and safe housing options limited my <life planning> ability and impacted my trust in the social services system.

As a future ~innovator~ in mental health and *artificial intelligence*, I am dedicated to healing mistrust by humanizing the justice of data-driven healthcare and publicizing the power of medical informatics so that we can bridge the intergenerational gap with technology.
