I am a frontend operations specialist and reasoning engineer who is passionate about leading the digital and physical transformation of our workplaces, sandboxes and labs to improve the quality of life for neurodivergents with disabilities and beyond.

As a future innovator in performance health and reinforcement learning, I am dedicated to healing mistrust by humanizing the justice of data-driven recruitment and retention and publicizing the power of performance informatics so that we can bridge the productivity gap with intelligent and ethical technology.
